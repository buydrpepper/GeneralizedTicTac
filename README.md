<h2>About</h2>
<p>-This is a game I made for a school assignment a while back. Try a variety of board sizes and winning lengths.</p>
<p>-The solving algorithm is purely heuristic, so it will lose to any optimized algorithm with a high search depth. However, it will beat any naive minmax algorithm (due to search depth limitations) and will probably beat you when playing on higher board sizes.</p>
<p>You can let it go first by toggling "Playing First". It always plays near the pieces already on the board, and plays a random middle square on its first move.</p>
